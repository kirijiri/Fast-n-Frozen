# Fast-n-Frozen

In context of an internship at the TU Dresden in 2005 we developed this computer game mod.
It is an Unreal Tournament Mod, in which penguins and seals race in the Arctic.

This project was creating in teams of 7, where I was almost exclusively busy making the seals, parts of the track and accessories in Maya, in addition to the HUD.
